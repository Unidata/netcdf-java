# Revision 1.3  2002/05/31 17:09:18  jimg
# Updated tests from C++. This includes some changes for the Java code.
#
# Revision 1.9.4.1  2001/11/01 00:43:52  jimg
# Fixes to the scanners and parsers so that dataset variable names may
# start with digits. I've expanded the set of characters that may appear
# in a variable name and made it so that all except `#' may appear at
# the start. Some characters are not allowed in variables that appear in
# a DDS or CE while they are allowed in the DAS. This makes it possible
# to define containers with names like `COARDS:long_name.' Putting a colon
# in a variable name makes the CE parser much more complex. Since the set
# of characters that people want seems pretty limited (compared to the
# complete ASCII set) I think this is an OK approach. If we have to open
# up the expr.lex scanner completely, then we can but not without adding
# lots of action clauses to teh parser. Note that colon is just an example,
# there's a host of characters that are used in CEs that are not allowed
# in IDs.
#
# Revision 1.9  2000/09/22 02:52:59  jimg
# Fixes to the tests to recognize some of the new error messages. Also,
# the test drivers were modified to catch the exceptions now thrown by
# some of the parsers.
#
# Revision 1.8  2000/06/16 18:15:01  jimg
# Merged with 3.1.7
#
# Revision 1.7.10.1  2000/06/15 02:24:56  jimg
# Fixed the tests: problems with PATH, etc. broke the tests on my new machine
#
# Revision 1.7  1999/03/24 23:42:22  jimg
# Added or updated for the new simple types (Int16, UInt16 and Float32)
#
# Revision 1.6  1997/05/13 23:29:12  jimg
# *** empty log message ***
#
# Revision 1.5  1997/03/27 18:19:53  jimg
# Update for version 2.13
#
# Revision 1.4  1996/11/13 19:23:40  jimg
# *** empty log message ***
#
# Revision 1.3  1996/08/12 22:22:14  jimg
# Changed for the new error message text from the parser.
#
# Revision 1.2  1996/05/14 15:40:42  jimg
# These changes have already been checked in once before. However, I
# corrupted the source repository and restored it from a 5/9/96 backup
# tape. The previous version's log entry should cover the changes.

# Added these tests. See comments in files in parent directory.
