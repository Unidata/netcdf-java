# Fixes to the scanners and parsers so that dataset variable names may
# start with digits. I've expanded the set of characters that may appear
# in a variable name and made it so that all except `#' may appear at
# the start. Some characters are not allowed in variables that appear in
# a DDS or CE while they are allowed in the DAS. This makes it possible
# to define containers with names like `COARDS:long_name.' Putting a colon
# in a variable name makes the CE parser much more complex. Since the set
# of characters that people want seems pretty limited (compared to the
# complete ASCII set) I think this is an OK approach. If we have to open
# up the expr.lex scanner completely, then we can but not without adding
# lots of action clauses to teh parser. Note that colon is just an example,
# there's a host of characters that are used in CEs that are not allowed
# in IDs.
