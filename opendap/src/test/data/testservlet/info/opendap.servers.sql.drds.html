<h2>DODS Relational Database Server</h2>

<p>
    This data is being served by a DODS Relational Database Server (DRDS), which
    is a somewhat unusual instance of a DODS server. All of the data served by the
    DRDS is stored in a relational database management system (DBMS). Queries from
    DODS clients are translated into SQL queries and sent to the underlying DBMS.
    The reuturned data is read by the DRDS and returned to the requesting client.
</p>

<p>
    Because the DRDS is essentially a front end to a DBMS, the DDS's have a somewhat
    different meaning than in other DODS servers. Each DDS served by the a DRDS
    represents a table in the underlying DBMS. Since queries to the DBMS will return
    an unknown amount of data, each DDS basically must contain a representation
    of the tables contents defined as a DODS <b>sequence</b>. Because of this it
    rarely makes sense for a client to request the entire &quot;dataset&quot;, as
    this request will return the entire contents of the table. When requesting data
    from a DRDS, it is best to get the dataset information (using the .info extension
    on the DODS URL) and then build a constrained request that just returns data
    that is actually desired. This doesn't mean that the entire table cannot be
    requested and sent, it is simply a caution that each dataset/DDS/table may in
    fact be very large.

<h3>Server Functions:</h3>
<p>
    <b>unique():</b> This function gets used in the selection part of the DODS
    constraint expression. It requires no parameters. Calling this funcion will
    cause the return to contain only unique rows. This is useful for sifting
    through numerous identical fields, for example station data that contains
    instrument names. This is NOT very useful if you are trying to retrieve a
    ship track...
    <br>Example:
    <pre>
        http://nasty.dods.url/server/dataset.dods?var1,var2&unique()
    </pre>
</p>


<p>
    <b>Regular Expressions:</b> The typical DODS server supports the full range
    regular expression syntax. THIS DODS server does not. Limited string matching is
    available. The wild card characters '.' and '.*' may used. The '[...]' notation
    for matching a range of characters may be used, but only to match a single
    character to a range of possiblities.
    <br>Examples:
    <pre>
        http://nasty.dods.url/server/dataset.dods?var1,var2&var3~=".*south.*"
        http://nasty.dods.url/server/dataset.dods?var1,var2&var3~=".south."
    </pre>
</p>

<p>
    <h3>NOTE:</h3> String fields in the DBMS may contain white space (spaces). In order
    for a constraint to match you must include the spaces. For example, if you
    wish to retrieve all data where a field called <i>location</i> has a value
    of "Southern Ocean", in your DODS URL you will have to represent the space
    between "Southern" and "Ocean" with the symbol "<b>%20</b>". Like this:
    <pre> location="Southern%20Ocean"</pre>
    However, if the DODS URL is formed with a space like this:
    <pre> location="Southern Ocean"</pre>
    It will not be handled correctly by the DRDS.
</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
