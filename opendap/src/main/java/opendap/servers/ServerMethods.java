/**
 * This interface defines the additional behaviors that Server side types
 * need to support. These include:
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * The file I/O operations of which each variable must be capable.
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * The projection information. A projection defines the variables
 * specified by a constraint to be returned by the server. These methods
 * store projection information for a non-vector variable. Each variable
 * type used on the server-side of OPeNDAP must implement this interface or
 * one of its descendents.
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * The methods that define how each type responds to relational
 * operators. Most (all?) types will not have sensible responses to all of
 * the relational operators (e.g. SDByte won't know how to match a regular
 * expression but SDString will). For those operators that are nonsensical a
 * class should throw InvalidOperator.
