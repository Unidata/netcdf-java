/**
 * Represents a sub-clause of the selection portion of a constraint
 * expression. A sub-clause is any part of a constraint that
 * can be evaluated to a BaseType value. For instance, the constraint
 * "var1>=function(var2,var3)" would have sub clauses "var1" and
 * "function(var2,var3)". The latter would in turn have the sub-clauses
 * "var2" and "var3".
 * <p>
 * <p/>
 * A given instance of SubClause may change the value it returns when
 * evaluated multiple times, but should not change the class of BaseType
 * it returns. This allows function and operator clauses to do type-checking
 * using the getValue() method.
 * <p/>
 * The parser supports several kinds of sub-clause. These are described
 * in the ClauseFactory interface.
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * See <code>TopLevelClause</code> for more about the parsing of clauses.
 * <p>
 * See <code>CEEValuator</code> for an explanation of how Clauses
 * are evaluated on data.
