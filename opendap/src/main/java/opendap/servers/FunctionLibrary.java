/**
 * Represents a library of available server-side functions for use
 * in evaluating constraint expressions.
 * <p>
 * <p/>
 * When created, a FunctionLibrary is empty.
 * There are two ways to populate it, described below. Once the
 * FunctionLibrary has been created and populated, it should be
 * used to create a ClauseFactory, which can then be given to
 * the CEEvaluator for use in parsing.
 * <p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * The most straightforward is to pass an instance of each
 * ServerSideFunction class to the add() method. If you have a large
 * number of ServerSideFunctions, or if you want to have choose class names
 * for your functions independent of the actual function name, this is the
 * approach to use.
 * <p/>
 * A second, more complex method resolves
 * server-side function names at runtime. The function library automatically
 * looks for a class whose
 * name matches the name requested (if a prefix is set, it will
 * look for a class whose name is prefix + name requested). If such a class
 * exists, and it implements the ServerSideFunction interface, a new instance
 * of the class is created using the default constructor, added to the list
 * of available functions, and returned to the caller.
 * <p>
 * <p/>
 * This is not quite as complicated as it sounds. For instance, say the
 * FunctionLibrary's prefix is set to "opendap.servers.test.SSF". Then the
 * first time
 * the server gets a constraint expression containing the function "dummy()",
 * the FunctionLibrary will
 * automatically load the class "opendap.servers.test.SSFdummy", and return
 * a new instance using the class's default constructor.
 * <p>
 * <p/>
 * This avoids the need to hardcode a list of server-side functions, and
 * allows you to create new functions at any time. For instance to create
 * a function "newfn()" you can simply
 * create the class "opendap.servers.test.SSFnewfn" and put it somewhere
 * in the server's classpath . Then the first CE containing this function will
 * cause that class to be automatically loaded, just the like the dummy()
 * function was.
