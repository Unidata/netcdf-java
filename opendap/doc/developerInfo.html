<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/"><strong><font size="+1">Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE)</font></strong></a></p>

<p><em><strong>Minimum</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Java 1.2<br>
    <em><strong>Recommended</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Java 1.4.1 or newer.</p>

<p>This software was developed and tested against the 1.4.1 release of the J2SE</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://javacc.dev.java.net/"><font size="+1">JavaCC</font></a></strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Minimum</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Optional (Only required if you lan on working on the parsers.)
    <br>
    <em><strong>Recommended</strong></em><strong>:</strong> 2.1 or higher. (<a href="#ANTWARNING">Warning!</a>)</p>

<p>Javacc takes a grammar file and produces a Java source code file from it.
    All of these resulting Java source files are checked into the CVS tree, so
    unless you anticipate working on the grammar files themselves you will not
    need to get Javacc. Most of the OPeNDAP parsers rely on the <strong>JavaCC</strong> tool
    to build. The parsers are built from a grammar file with a .jj extension. The
    grammars
    contain
    the rules for
    both the scanner and the parser (and thus encapsulate both the functionalities
    of <strong>lex</strong> and <strong>yacc</strong>). The Javacc tool appears
    to be a red headed step child of the Java development community. Originally
    it was written by someone at Sun Microsystems ( possibly Bill Joy?). Eventually
    it was farmed off to small company called WebGain. It now appears that WebGain
    went
    under
    in
    the Dot Com bust and now
    Sun has
    it
    in an
    Open Source project under the BSD license. I think it survives because it does
    something important, we can't live without it, and there is nothing else like
    it out there. If you are going to work on the parsers you should :</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html"><font size="+1">Jakarta Tomcat
</font></a></strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Minimum</strong></em><strong>:</strong> 4.1.18<br>
    <em><strong>Recommended</strong></em><strong>:</strong> 4.1.27</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This code has not been tested against version 5 of Tomcat!</p>

<p>The servlets were developed and tested using Jakarta/Tomcat 4.1.18. In particular,
    the code was linked against the servlet.jar bundled with this particular version
    of Tomcat. This is not (to the best
    of my knowledge) a library that is included with the standard Java distributions.</p>
