<p>The OPeNDAP software started life as the Distributed Oceanographic Data System
    (DODS) project. Here are the release notes from previous version of the Java-DODS
    software on which OPeNDAP is based:</p>

<p><strong>Java-DODS Release 1.1.3</strong> -- 05/12/03 (ndp)<br>
    This is a supplemental release of 1.1 that contains the fixes mentioned below
    plus a fix of a regexp problem in the DRDS (bug 608).</p>

<p><strong>Java-DODS Release 1.1.2 </strong>-- 03/11/03
    (ndp)<br>
    This is a supplemental release of 1.1 that contains bug fixes for server side
    issues that only exhibit on the Windows operating system.</p>

<p>J<strong>ava-DODS Release 1.1.1</strong> -- 4/9/02 (ndp)<br>
    This is a supplemental
    release of 1.1 that contains bug fixes for DDS, and DAS parser problems and
    repairs
    to the DRDS constraint expression handling.</p>

<p><strong>Java-DODS Release 1.1.0</strong> -- 06/11/01 (ndp)<br>
    Repaired DODS relational Database Server (DRDS, dods.servers.sql.drds) so that
    it correctly handles &quot;null&quot; values in the backend database
    tables. Repaired DODS Test Server (DTS, dods.servers.test.dts). Test server output
    is now stable.<br>
</p>

<p><br>
    <strong>Java-DODS Release 1.0.0</strong> -- 10/13/00 (ndp)<br>
    Placed the majority of the server diagnostic output under conditional control.
    Found and fixed several bugs in the server code including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Problem with the
        string types where if a user requests variable x from a server and constrains
        it on y and y is a string the server was returning y too. (example:
        http://DODS.URL/dataset.dods?x&amp;y=&quot;bob&quot;)</li>
    <li>Constraint Expressions
        were simply not working.*</li>
    <li>The right operand in the Clause's of the constraint
        expression was not being
        correctly marked by the ExprParser (thanks to James G. for the fix.)
        This should help things a bit.<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Release 1.0.6 </strong>(ndp)
</p>

<p>Many things have been changed and re-arranged:
    The servlets should now be thread safe. Much of the core
    servlet code has been re-architected and should be carefully
    reviewed if you have been using it and wish to continue to
    use it.
    The servlet NO LONGER USES .ini files. All configuration information
    is no passed to the servlet through the javax.servlet.ServletConfig
    interface (in particular the getInitParameter() method). This information
    is stored in the web.xml file located in the WEB-INF directory for
    the servlet. See the file SERVLET for more information.
    The special clients www and ascii have been moved from
    dods.clients to dods.servers (dods.servers.www and dods.servers.ascii
    respectively) </p>

<p><strong>Release 1.0 </strong>(ndp) </p>

<p>This is the first full release of the Java-DODS core software.
    Some fairly significant organizational changes have been made
    since Jake's original code, and since Beta 1.1. If you have been
    using the code it would behoove you to review the inheritance
    hierarchy, the functional hierarchy, and the organization of
    the packages. In particular this release ships with 2 functional
    servers (dods.servers.test.dts and dods.servers.test.drds), 1
    functional client (dods.clients.geturl.Geturl), 2 special clients
    (dods.clients.ascii and dods.clients.www) that get used in the
    server architecture. The problems that Jake pointed out below about
    Input/Output Stream's and Reader/Writer's still remain to be
    resolved, and unfortunately this means that we are still using
    deprecated API's in several places.**NOTE: The test suites are currently
    broken. They did work, but changes in
    test server (repeated identical calls for the same dataset will produce
    different, although predictable, data) have rendered them non functional
    for the time being.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Beta 1.0 </strong>(ndp) </p>

<p>At this time the Server side code has been written. Class hierarchies
    have been cleaned up and in general the core code in the &quot;dap&quot; is
    tight and clean. Many of the ancillary programs written by Jake have
    not been extensively tested, this includes Geturl. The Server code
    has been tested and seems to work well. </p>

    included as part of our legacy.</em>

<h3><strong>Jake's Original Design Notes</strong></h3>

<p>The following are some notes about the design
    and implementation of
    the Java DAP library. It should be useful reading for anyone who
    needs to fix bugs or add features to this code.</p>

<p><strong>Design Differences</strong></p>

<p>The definitive documentation for the DAP is contained in the Javadoc
    comments included with the source code. You can build this
    documentation with the &quot;make doc&quot; target of the Makefile. Here are
    some important differences between the API described in the Javadoc
    comments, and the C++ version of DODS, as well as James Gallagher's
    initial Java DAP design.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only the client-side design is implemented in this library. This
        code can form a base for a Java DODS server, but several important
        pieces of functionality will need be written. These include: the
        Projection, RelOps and ServerIO interfaces from James' design, the
        Function and ServerDDS classes, and the Constraint Evaluator (CE).<br>
    </li>
    <li> Unlike
        James' design, which had a single Attribute class, this implementation
        features separate Attribute and AttributeTable classes,
        which more closely correspond to the C++ implementation's AttrTable
        class and its 'entry' structure.<br>
    </li>
    <li> One weakness of the C++ implementation
        is the lack of encapsulation for the different DODS types. In particular,
        a number of core
        classes, including BaseType.cc, have to be aware of every DODS type.
        Also, being able to set and get the type of a variable overrides the
        natural class hierarchy accessible in C++ through RTTI (which, in
        fairness, wasn't available when the C++ DODS was written), and in Java
        through the 'instanceof' operator. Therefore, when designing the Java
        DAP, I ensured that the BaseType class has no special knowledge of
        particular DODS types, and that adding new DODS types would be as easy
        as possible. Information on doing so is described later in this file.<br>
    </li>
    <li> As part
        of the encapsulation requirement set forth in the previous point, I added
        a new class, PrimitiveVector, to manage arrays of each
        primitive BaseType. Each primitive type (DByte, DInt32, etc.) defines
        its own PrimitiveVector class, which stores arrays of that primitive
        type in a very compact form (byte[], int[], etc.). There is also a
        generic BaseTypePrimitiveVector, which stores arrays of the DString
        type, as well as more complex types (DStructure, etc.).
        PrimitiveVector is public so that DODS clients can get and set the individual
        values of each array type efficiently by retrieving the PrimitiveVector
        object from the DVector and then casting it to the
        appropriate child (BytePrimitiveVector, etc.).<br>
    </li>
    <li> One source of many problems
        in the C++ core was the implementation of Sequence. This table type is the
        only DODS type which must be
        deserialized repeatedly, once for each row of the table. While this
        design may be useful when deserializing a very large dataset
        asynchronously, it complicates the deserialization process for all
        other types which have to deal with sequences. When designing the
        Java core, I wrote DSequence to retrieve all rows of the table with a
        single call to the deserialize method. Because there is currently no
        asynchronous getData method (the entire dataset is retrieved fully
        populated) in the Java core, the user of the Java core can be
        confident that either they will have received the entire dataset from
        the getData call, or an exception will be thrown. This vastly
        simplifies usage of this library by clients. Users who might desire
        the asynchronous deserialization approach should be able to get the
        same result by using Java threads and the StatusUI interface.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Java Pitfalls</strong></p>

<p>Here are some miscellaneous comments on particular aspects of Java
    which I had to deal with when designing the Java DAP. Hopefully you
    won't stumble into these pitfalls yourself if I mention them here:</p>
<ul>
<li>InputStream vs. Reader: The biggest change in the java.io package
    between Java 1.0 and 1.1 was the addition of a number of new classes
    based on the Reader and Writer abstract classes instead of the
    InputStream and OutputStream abstract classes used in Java 1.0. This
    addition is very confusing because many other areas of Java, including
    the standard input and output (System.in, System.out, and System.err)
    and the java.net classes (URLConnection's getInputStream method),
    continue to support only the older InputStream and OutputStream.<br>
    <br>
    Also, neither
    class is a proper superset of the other: the DataInputStream class is the
    only built in way to read binary values,
    such as 'int' and 'double' types, while the BufferedReader provides
    the only non-deprecated way to read a line of text as a String. It's
    possible to wrap an InputStream with a Reader, but not possible to go
    in the other direction.<br>
    <br>
    Furthermore, the BufferedReader has the limitation of
    reading ahead (or buffering, hence the name) in the stream, which means that
    the
    original InputStream can't be used after it has been wrapped in a
    BufferedReader. This is why the DConnect class uses the deprecated
    DataInputStream.readLine() method, because it must use the InputStream
    as a DataInputStream (and not a Reader) later in the code. Using a
    deprecated method is probably the easiest way to solve this problem,
    and I'm explaining the reasoning in detail here in case a future
    programmer is bothered by the use of a deprecated method. By the way,
    the reason this method was deprecated is because it doesn't properly
    handle Unicode: since the C++ version of DODS doesn't even attempt to
    handle Unicode, I don't think this is a big concern! <br>
</li>
<li> The JavaCC generated
    parser classes perform their own buffering. Therefore it's not necessary
    to use a BufferedReader or
    BufferedInputStream. However, because of this lookahead, it was
    necessary for me to write a line-buffering class called
    HeaderInputStream to not allow the parser to read beyond the &quot;Data:&quot;
    line. When reading data from DODS, the server sends the DDS, followed
    by a &quot;Data:&quot; line, then the actual data. Without my HeaderInputStream
    in the middle, the parser was reading the DDS, and buffering ahead all
    of the data as well. HeaderInputStream is a very naive filter, and
    could certainly be optimized for better performance, however I've not
    profiled the code, so I don't know if it's a bottleneck or not.<br>
</li>
<li> A note on
    BufferedWriter: the DAS, DDS, and DataDDS print methods which take an OutputStream
    parameter wrap it in a BufferedWriter for
    better performance. This allows a simple client to pass System.out
    directly to the print method and expect reasonable performance.
    However, note the importance of calling the flush method on the
    BufferedWriter before returning from the print method, or else the
    data might not be output. Again, this is all handled by the DAP, but
    if you use BufferedWriter in your own code, make sure to properly
    flush the stream at regular intervals, or you might not see the output
    you expected.<br>
</li>
<li> A major component of the DAP is the use of the XDR library to
    encode binary data in a platform independent manner. Fortunately, in Java,
    there is little need for an XDR library, because the DataInputStream
    class makes it easy to read XDR data. The only complexity is
    reading the Byte types, because all XDR values are padded to a
    multiple of 4 bytes, thus necessitating insertion of padding in bytes,
    byte arrays, and strings. For more information on the XDR format,
    look up the RFC 1014 Internet standard.<br>
</li>
<li> DODS has support for unsigned types
    (UInt32), while Java does not. However, it is possible to print a Java int
    as if it were unsigned
    through a clever trick: cast the int to a long (64-bit) and mask
    off the sign bits: </li>

<pre> long tempVal = ((long)val) &amp; 0xFFFFFFFFL; </pre>

<p>Therefore, the only significant difference between DInt32 and DUInt32
    is in the print method, so the DUInt32 class inherits from DInt32. </p>
<li> The
    above tip, and many other useful tips, are listed in the Java Programmers
    FAQ, available here:
    http://www.best.com/~pvdl/javafaq.html.<br>
</li>
<li> One interesting feature of the Java
    DAP is that many of the classes implement the Cloneable interface. This
    enables an entire DAS or DDS
    to be cloned by a line like the following: </li>

<pre> DAS newDAS = (DAS)oldDAS.clone(); </pre>

<p>The implementation of the clone method is different from the default
    implementation supported by most Java classes in that it performs a
    deep copy of all data contained in it. This means that once a DAS or
    DDS is cloned, it is completely independent, and any future
    modifications made to either class won't affect the other.</p>
<li>Thread safety
    is an important, and underrated issue, affecting many Java programs. The
    Java DAP is nominally threadsafe in that the
    deserialize method is marked as 'synchronized', which means that only
    one thread can load new data into a DDS at a time. This is not
    strictly necessary because deserialization is normally handled behind
    the scenes in a single thread of the core, but it may be useful in the
    future. Also, there are no uses of global or static variables or
    other inherently non-threadsafe designs in the core. In particular,
    the &quot;STATIC = false&quot; option is supplied in all three JavaCC generated
    parsers, which means that multiple instances of the parser can be run
    at once without conflicting.<br>
    <br>
    One use of the DAP which should be totally
    threadsafe is reading multiple DAS's or DDS's at the same time, using separate
    DConnect
    objects (pointing to the same or different URL's). Trying to read the
    DAS, DDS, and Data at the same time from the same DConnect object
    should also work, since a new URLConnection is created inside the
    method, but this hasn't been tested. Deserializing the DAS, DDS, or
    Data while simultaneously reading out the values will probably not
    work, but this is prevented by the design of DConnect, which only
    returns fully downloaded DAS, DDS, or DataDDS objects.<br>
</li>
<li> If you need to debug
    the parser code, you'll probably want to comment out the try/catch block
    for ParseException in the parser
    source (e.g. DASParser.jj for the DAS parser). This code catches an
    exception thrown by the parser and rethrows a much more general
    exception, which is probably less useful if you suspect a bug in the
    parser itself. Temporarily commenting these lines out will return a
    very specific error from the parser describing what line the error
    occurred and which token or tokens were expected.<br>
</li>
<li> In the Java Geturl client,
    you may notice particularly ugly printing of floating point values. For example,
    0.3 prints as &quot;
    0.30000000000000004&quot;. This is because Java, by default, prints
    floating point numbers to their full precision, such that reading the
    ASCII version will produce a number bit for bit identical with the
    original. It is possible to &quot;pretty-print&quot; floating point numbers
    using the java.text.NumberFormat class, but I didn't use this, as it
    doesn't support exponential notation for very large or very small numbers.<br>
</li>
<li> One
    feature of Java is its support for Unicode characters. These are usually
    sent over the network in UTF-8 format, which uses a single
    byte to represent the 7-bit ASCII characters, and two or three bytes
    to represent the other characters in the 16-bit Unicode format.
    Unfortunately, Unicode support is not easy in C++, and DODS currently
    provides no international character support. Theoretically, one could
    use the upper 128 characters in the ISO Latin 1 codeset in the C++
    DODS to represent all characters used in the Western European
    languages, but in both C++ and Java, I've chosen to escape any
    characters outside of the usual 7-bit printable ASCII range for
    clarity. If international character support is needed in the future,
    then I suggest that the Unicode UTF-8 encoding be adopted, and that
    this be converted into whatever format is used by the native OS on the
    C++ side.<br>
</li>
<li> If you'd like to use the DAP code in a Java applet, you'll need
    to be aware of the security restrictions surrounding applets. In
    particular, applets are normally only allowed to establish network
    connections to the host from which they are downloaded. This
    restriction was designed to prevent a malicious applet from contacting
    hosts on your internal network and giving that information to an
    attacker outside the firewall. However, for DODS, this restriction is
    unfortunate, because a Java DODS applet may want to communicate with
    many different DODS servers. In this case, you can use a signed
    applet which asks the user for permission to relax this security
    restriction. The alternate would be to write a DODS proxy server to
    sit on the Web server and retrieve DODS URL's from the other sites
    which the applet can't directly access.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>

<p>Here is some information about the test cases written for this code:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The das-check and dds-check testsuites were ported almost directly
        from the C++ code. The fact that the testsuite returns identical
        results to the C++ version is a testament to the compatibility between
        the two versions.<br>
    </li>
    <li> The dap-check target is a new test program to programmatically
        construct a DAS and DDS, fill them with data, clone them (thus testing
        the Cloneable interface), and verify the original contents.<br>
    </li>
    <li> The server-check
        target is a port of the C++ HDF DODS server, and unlike the other tests,
        returns slightly different results from its
        C++ counterpart. The primary difference is that floating point values
        print slightly differently in Java (more digits of precision).
        Another difference is that the order in which DAS attributes are
        printed is occasionally different from the C++ version, due to the use
        of a C++ map class (DASVHMap) which doesn't always preserve the order
        in which the DAS was downloaded. Finally, there are a few
        inconsistencies in the C++ printing of Sequence (indentation of braces
        is inconsistent) and UInt32 (printed as &quot;Uint32&quot; in C++) which the
        Java version corrects.<br>
    </li>
    <li> Areas which have not been tested include the old Sequence
        deserialize protocol and deserializing a Function. This should not
        present a big concern because the code is straightforward enough that
        it should work, and because both cases are somewhat rare (the old
        Sequence protocol was buggy and limited, so servers using it should be
        upgraded anyway, and the DODS Function type has been deprecated). </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Adding New Types To The Dap</strong></p>

<p>Unlike the C++ version of DODS, the Java DAP port was designed to make
    it easy to add new data types to the core. Here are the places where
    the code will need to be changed to incorporate a new primitive type: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Add the new type as a class inheriting from BaseType. Implement all
        required methods, using an existing class, like DInt32, as an example.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li> Add a new PrimitiveVector class to handle arrays of the new type. See
        Int32PrimitiveVector as an example. Your new type class will
        return this new vector type in its newPrimitiveVector method. <br>
    </li>
    <li> Add methods
        to the BaseTypeFactory interface and DefaultFactory class to construct a
        new instance of your type. See the existing
        methods as an example.<br>
    </li>
    <li> Add code to the DDSParser.jj to recognize your new
        type when listed in a DAS or DDS.<br>
    </li>
    <li> If your type is a primitive type which
        you want to allow in a DAS Attribute, then edit the Attribute class and DASParser.jj
        to recognize
        your new type when converted to String form.<br>
    </li>
    <li> If you have written a Java
        DODS server (which is not currently possible, since only the client portion
        of the DAP is implemented in
        Java), then you may want to add this type to the list that is
        currently served. </li>
    <li></li>
    <li>If you have written a Java DODS client which has detailed
        knowledge of the DODS types (unavoidable unless you want to limit yourself
        to
        printing out the data in ASCII, as Geturl does), then you will need to
        add knowledge of the new data type to your client.Jake Hamby (Jake.Hamby@jpl.nasa.gov)
