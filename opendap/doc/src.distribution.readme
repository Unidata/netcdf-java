                      Source Distribution README

.......................................................................



This is the source code distribution for Java-OPeNDAP. It relies on the
ANT program (http://ant.apache.org) to exercise it's production rules.

It contains:

    * The source code files for the Java-OPeNDAP project. Files
      located in "src" directory.

    * Documentation located in the "doc" directory.

    * Ancillary libraries required to compile. Files located in
      the "lib" directory.

    *  ANT build files located in the "buildfiles" directory.

The basic compile targets (dap, servers, compile, clean-compile, doc)
work. The more complex distribution related targets don't work, as many
of the necessary files are not included here. The complete file-set is
available in the Java-OPeNDAP subversion repository, for those of you that
just  have to have the whole shooting match.

To build all of the source code go to the top level directory (below
which should be the Java-OPeNDAP and buildfiles directories) and run the
command:

    ant -f buildfiles/opendap.xml compile

Read the build file "buildfiles/opendap.xml" to see what it all does.

Happy Coding.
