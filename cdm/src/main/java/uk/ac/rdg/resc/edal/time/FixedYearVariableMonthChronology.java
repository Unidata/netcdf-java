/**
 * <p>A {@link Chronology} in which each year has the same number of days but
 * the lengths of the months may be different.  May be useful for climate and
 * palaeoclimate calendars.</p>
 * <p>In this Chronology, a millisecond instant of zero corresponds with
 * 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z and a year has a fixed number of milliseconds.</p>
 * <p>There is no concept of an era in this calendar, so all durations and fields
 * relating to this concept are not supported.  Additionally, the concept of a
 * "weekyear" (the year that "owns" a given week) is not implemented.</p>
 * <p>Instances of this class can only be created in {@link "DateTimeZone#UTC"}.
 * (Support for time zones makes little sense in this chronology).</p>
 * <p>Instances of this class are immutable.</p>
