 * From https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/faq.html#How-many-netCDF-formats-are-there-and-what-are-the-
 * differences-among-them
 * 
 * Q: How many netCDF formats are there, and what are the differences among them?
 * 
 * A: There are four netCDF format variants:
 * 
 * - the classic format
 * - the 64-bit offset format
 * - the 64-bit data format
 * - the netCDF-4 format
 * - the netCDF-4 classic model format
 * 
 * (In addition, there are two textual representations for netCDF data, though these are not usually thought of as
 * formats: CDL and NcML.)
 * 
 * The classic format was the only format for netCDF data created between 1989 and 2004 by the reference software from
 * Unidata.
 * It is still the default format for new netCDF data files, and the form in which most netCDF data is stored.
 * This format is also referred as CDF-1 format.
 * 
 * In 2004, the 64-bit offset format variant was added. Nearly identical to netCDF classic format, it allows users to
 * create and access
 * far larger datasets than were possible with the original format. (A 64-bit platform is not required to write or read
 * 64-bit offset
 * netCDF files.) This format is also referred as CDF-2 format.
 * 
 * In 2008, the netCDF-4 format was added to support per-variable compression, multiple unlimited dimensions, more
 * complex data types,
 * and better performance, by layering an enhanced netCDF access interface on top of the HDF5 format.
 * 
 * At the same time, a fourth format variant, netCDF-4 classic model format, was added for users who needed the
 * performance benefits
 * of the new format (such as compression) without the complexity of a new programming interface or enhanced data model.
 * 
 * In 2016, the 64-bit data format variant was added. To support large variables with more than 4-billion array
 * elements, it replaces
 * most of the 32-bit integers used in the format specification with 64-bit integers. It also adds support for several
 * new data types
 * including unsigned byte, unsigned short, unsigned int, signed 64-bit int and unsigned 64-bit int. A 64-bit platform
 * is required to
 * write or read 64-bit data netCDF files. This format is also referred as CDF-5 format.
 * 
 * With each additional format variant, the C-based reference software from Unidata has continued to support access to
 * data stored in
 * previous formats transparently, and to also support programs written using previous programming interfaces.
 * 
 * Although strictly speaking, there is no single "netCDF-3 format", that phrase is sometimes used instead of the more
 * cumbersome but
 * correct "netCDF classic CDF-1, 64-bit offset CDF-2, or 64-bit data CDF-5 format" to describe files created by the
 * netCDF-3
 * (or netCDF-1 or netCDF-2) libraries. Similarly "netCDF-4 format" is sometimes used informally to mean "either the
 * general netCDF-4 format
 * or the restricted netCDF-4 classic model format". We will use these shorter phrases in FAQs below when no confusion
 * is likely.
 * 
 * A more extensive description of the netCDF formats and a formal specification of the classic and 64-bit formats is
 * available as a NASA ESDS community standard
 * (https://earthdata.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/esdswg/spg/rfc/esds-rfc-011/ESDS-RFC-011v2.00.pdf)
 * 
 * The 64-bit data CDF-5 format specification is available in
 * http://cucis.ece.northwestern.edu/projects/PnetCDF/CDF-5.html.
