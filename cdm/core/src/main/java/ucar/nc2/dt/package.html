<body>
<pre> DEPRECATED API - THIS AND ALL SUBPACKAGES WILL BE REPLACED / MOVE: Scientific data types package.</pre>
<p> These are interfaces that define access to specialized "scientific datatype" datasets. There are three types of interfaces:
<ol>
<li>Datatype: atomic datatype usually defined by its dimensionality and topology.  
<li>Collection: a homogenous collection of atomic types, specifying the nature of the collection.
<li>Dataset: usually a Collection of a particular Datatype.
</ol>
<p> A TypedDataset and TypedVariable are lightweight abstractions of NetcdfDataset and Variable, which allows implementations that are not necessarily based on NetcdfDataset objects.
