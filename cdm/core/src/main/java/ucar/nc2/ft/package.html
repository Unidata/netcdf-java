<pre>DEPRECATED API - THIS AND ALL SUBPACKAGES WILL BE REPLACED / MOVE:  Scientific feature types package</pre>
<p> These are interfaces that define access to specialized "scientific feature" datasets. There are three types of interfaces:
<ol>
<li>FeatureType: atomic type usually defined by its dimensionality and topology.
<li>Collection: a homogeneous collection of atomic types, specifying the nature of the collection.
<li>Dataset: one or more Collections of a particular FeatureType, with dataset metadata.
</ol>
<p> A FeatureDataset and VariableSimpleIF are lightweight abstractions of NetcdfDataset and Variable, which allows implementations that are
    not necessarily based on NetcdfDataset objects.
