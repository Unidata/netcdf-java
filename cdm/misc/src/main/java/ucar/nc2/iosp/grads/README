The GradsBinaryGridServiceProvider currently handles:

- raw lat/lon binary grid files (DTYPE not defined)
- ensembles defined by NAMES in one file or as a template
- gaussian latitudes
- time templates

It does not handle:
- other DTYPEs since these are readable through other IOSPs
- projected data (PDEF)
- cross-sections since there isn't enough metadata to define the
  single x or y dimension
- ensembles defined by EDEF/ENDEDEF
- some miscellaneous options:
    - zrev - no examples
    - 365_day_calendar - no support in netCDF-Java for imaginary times
    - byteswapped - no examples, bad way to do it
    - cray_32bit_ieee - no examples

For the ensemble EDEF/ENDEDEF, one would need:

- mods to GradsEnsembleDimension to get the list of filenames  
   - this could probably be done by adding them as levels/names and then
     parsing those.
- understand how the varying time dimensions work
- a mapping of a filename to the time dimensions
- possible reordering of the netCDF coordinates to support varying
  time dimensions.
