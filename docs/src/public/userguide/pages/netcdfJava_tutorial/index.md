Welcome to the netCDF-Java tutorial.
The netCDF-Java Library is a Java interface to [netCDF files](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/index.html){:target="_blank"}, as well as to many other types of [scientific data formats](file_types.html).

The library is freely available and the source code is released under the [BSD-3 license](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-java/blob/master/LICENSE){:target="_blank"}.
Previous versions used the (MIT-style) netCDF C library license, and before that, the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

The preferred place to ask questions, discuss problems and features and get support is in the netCDF-Java email list, which you can subscribe to [from this page](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/support/index.html#mailinglists){:target="_blank"}.
Also you might want to search or [browse previous netCDF-Java support questions](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/mailing_lists/archives/netcdf-java/){:target="_blank"}.
