   - download "gribex" software from http://www.ecmwf.int/products/data/software/grib.html
   - extract gribex_000370/gribtables/* to resources/grib1/ecmwf/
   - these appear to include wmo standard tables and local tables for center 98 (ecmwf), 74 (ukmet RFSC), 80 (rome NMC), 85 (toulouse RMSC)
   - wmo versions 1,2,3 all agree with each other
   - udunit differences with dss wmo version 3:
       10 udunits
         Dobson
         Dobson.(kg.m-2)
       19 udunits

         K.s-1

 12/5/2011 look closer at the wmostd/* tables
  - all are identical except for minor spelling and capitilization
  - except table_2_version_003.mf which may be just a french translation
  - unit differences with dss/WMO_GRIB1.xml as above

 12/5/2011 look closer at the cen074/* tables
  - version 174 and 175 are identical

    "GRIBEX has been replaced by GRIB API. GRIBEX is not available for download and is not maintained nor supported any longer."
  2. missing params in Q:/support/CarlosMoraga/ECMWF_GNERA_d0001.20121001
  3. send email to marcos, stephan to try to get canonical ecmwf tables.
