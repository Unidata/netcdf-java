# B2L-058-000-D - Special local BUFR Table D for center 058 (FNMOC) for those
# cases when an FNOC-generated BUFR message uses local descriptors but has a
# value of 0 in Section 1, Octet 12 (thus indicating that it does not use
# local descriptors).
#
# Descriptor sequences are terminated with -1
#
# Sequences do not need to appear in any order.  Sequence A
# which includes sequence B, may appear before sequence B
# is defined.
#

# Phony local descriptors left over from debuggin
