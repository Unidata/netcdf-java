Hi John,
  I've added a file called  MEL_BUFR_Tables.tar to the same ftp directory.  This contains all the tables needed, but may contain some that aren't needed.  I don't know exactly where the tables come from.  They change occasionally (actually rarely, but usually without prior notice).   The last time they changed (5/2006) Sue Uhrich was able to find the correct tables for me, so she may be able to answer questions about who maintains the tables at FNMOC ( sue.uhrich@fnmoc.navy.mil ).

Good luck and let me know if you need anything else.

Lynn
