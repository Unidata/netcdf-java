0) Convert WMO xls to csv:

delete other columns, so you just have:

SNo,Category,FXY1,enElementName1,FXY2,enElementName2 <other columns ok>

"save as" csv.

4) i think this is a typo in the version 13 doc:

474    02    302044    (Evaporation data)    013003    Evaporation /evapotranspiration

should be:

474    02    302044    (Evaporation data)    013033    Evaporation /evapotranspiration
