# netCDF-Java/CDM

The netCDF Java library provides an interface for scientific data access.
It can be used to read scientific data from a variety of file formats including netCDF, HDF, GRIB, BUFR, and many others.
By itself, the netCDF-Java library can only write netCDF-3 files.
It can write netCDF-4 files by using JNI to call the netCDF-C library.
It also implements Unidata's Common Data Model (CDM) to provide data geolocation capabilities.

## NetCDF Markup Language (NcML)

NcML is an XML representation of netCDF metadata, it approximates the header information one gets from a netCDF file with the "ncdump -h" command.
NcML is similar to the netCDF CDL (network Common data form Description Language), except, of course, it uses XML syntax.

Beyond simply describing a netCDF file, it can also be used to describe changes to existing netCDF files.
A limited number of tools, mainly netCDF-Java based tools, support these features of NcML.

For more information about NcML, see the NcML web page at

https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-java/5.0/userguide/ncml_overview.html

## THREDDS Catalogs

THREDDS Catalogs can be thought of as representing logical directories of on-line data resources.
They are encoded as XML and provide a place for annotations and other metadata about the data resources.
While the THREDDS Data Server (TDS) generates THREDDS Catalogs, THREDDS Catalogs are not limited to those produced by the TDS.
These XML documents are how THREDDS-enabled data consumers find out what data is available from data providers.

THREDDS Catalog documentation (including the specification) is available at

* https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/tds/5.0/userguide/basic_client_catalog.html
